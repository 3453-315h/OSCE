### FTPShell Server v6.80
Structured Exception Handler (SEH) overwrite exploit found during my prep to take on OSCE, had to look for an address outside the range of loaded modules (including base image) in order to bypass `safeSEH`. See the link [EDB-ID: 44713](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44713/)
